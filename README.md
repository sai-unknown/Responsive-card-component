## 🛠 How It Works

1. When the page loads, a fullscreen **preloader** with a spinning Sharingan appears.
2. After a short delay (~1s), the preloader disappears and the **main content (cards)** fades in.
3. Each card contains:
   - Character image
   - Short description
   - Link to full character bio on the Naruto Fandom Wiki

## 🔧 Customization Tips

- 🔁 Replace `Sharingan.png` in the `assets/` folder with any custom image if you want a different loader.
- 🖼 Add or remove character cards easily by duplicating the `.column.is-one-third` block.
- 🎨 Modify `style.css` to change animation speed, shadows, colors, or sizes.
